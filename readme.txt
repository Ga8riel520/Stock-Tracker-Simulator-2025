In this folder,it contains stock_tracker.py , test_stock_tracker.py , test_result.txt , 2100Report1.pdf.
2100Report1.pdf is a report explaining the algorithm.
stock_tracker.py contains all the operations required.
test_stock_tracker.py is used to test the operations.
It will randomly generate 10000 stocks and done the operations in the guideline.
Operation will be saved to a list for each operations.

For example,
insert-new-stock 155159 23.546610296991336
update-price 583480 62.246847567420325
increase-volume 583480 91
Therefore,test_result.txt is used to save the all operations in whole execution.It should contains 40110 lines after executed.

In order to test the program,you just need to execute the test_stock_tracker.py.And the result will be saved in test_result.txt.
